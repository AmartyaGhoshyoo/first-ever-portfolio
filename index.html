            <h1>The Journey</h1>
            <h3>The journey hasn't end yet sadly It's the beginning</h3>
            <p>If I start with me then it'll be a story with full of disappointment.Though I decided to stand again
                against my emotion cause if I stay on my knee life will let me stay.Right now my biggest enemy is my
                emotion and regretfully society is the one who is feeding my emotion for making it strong enough for
                defeating me.I think one day everything will go north instead of south and am not waiting for this day
                to come instead I'll make this day for myself.I have long way to go instead seeing dramas society making
                around me.</p>
