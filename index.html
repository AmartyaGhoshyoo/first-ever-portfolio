            <h1>The Journey</h1>
            <h3>The journey hasn't end yet sadly It's the beginning</h3>
            <p>If I start with me then it'll be a story with full of disappointment.I better not start though I decided
                to stand up again
                against my emotion cause if I stay on my knee,life will let me stay there forever.Right now my biggest
                enemy is my
                emotion and regretfully society is the one who is feeding my emotion for making it strong enough for
                defeating me.I think one day everything will go North instead of South and am not waiting for this day
                to come instead I'll make this day for myself.I have long way to go instead of seeing dramas that are
                being made by societies
                around me.</p>

                <h3>Time will not stop for you</h3>
                <p>It's a start of a new chapter of my life.Varsity life about to start but can't leave my past behind.I
                    can't live with my own failure.Gotta move on but can't.Need more time to deal with this shit.I still
                    remember when I was a child I always wanted to be Programmer though I hadn't had any single idea
                    about
                    this,all I focused that time that I like pc and I wanna do something or be attached with this and
                    that thought of
                    then
                    lead me here A New Journey to become a Programmer.</p>

                <h3>You can't escape from reality</h3>
                <p>
                    Things aren't that easy as It seems to be.It's just a beginning where everyone puts a smile on their
                    face.But slowly everything starts to fade away with time.A many given up their smile forever but
                    there
                    are
                    some who start to figure it out like what's wrong with them or what's going on or happening.They
                    don't
                    feel
                    ok until they get to know how to overcome from this shit.Once they over come this shit End Of The
                    day
                    they are the main successor of life.
